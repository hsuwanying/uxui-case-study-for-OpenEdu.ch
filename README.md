# UX|UI Case Study: OPENEDU.CH

#### Optimizing use experience and web usability by redesigning search, filters and uploading file process 


## Summary

Usability, user experience and value proposition are the main objectives we want to solve within the project timeline. In this document, User Experience and User Interface are addressed based on a series of analyses, from investigating initial problems to be solved to delivering an interactive visual prototype that aligns with technical solutions and user goals.

This document is submitted as part of the deliverable for the WIKIMEDIA.CH data science project challenge for OPENEDU.CH.

Full Project documentation and code can be seen on [OpeneduC - GitHub](https://github.com/WomenPlusPlus/deploy-impact-22-openedu-c)

## Overview

### About OPENEDU.CH

**OPENEDU.CH** is launched in 2020 by the WIKIMEDIA CH organization. **OPENEDU.CH** is an open education resource platform, that advocates fair education, and encourages educators to connect, collaborate and share knowledge through this platform. Through this platform, educators can benefit from accessing educational rescore on any topic, anywhere, in addition,  **OPENEDU.CH** also provides training services and tools upon request. To achieve a business goal, and build such a platform,  a strategic business analysis and data-driven approach are needed.


### The Process

To achieve the business goal, the **Double Diamond Process Model** is applied as this model is not only focused on design elements but taking a holistic view to design a system that can be run technically and visually. The Double Diamond Process Model consists of four phases as follows:

- **Discover:** 
  - Understand what is ontology; who are the key stakeholders, and how they will be affected by the ontology.
  - Reverse the existing database structure, and design, function, and service that offer on the current website  
- **Define:** 
  - Gathering insights from all team members and defining the domain and purpose of ontology and formulating the structure of the database 
  - Identify key problems that need to be addressed now. we decided to focus on optimizing searching, filtering and uploading functions.
- **Develop:** Once we define our key problems, and common goal, we divieded tasks based on member's expertise, which are **Database**, **Data science**  and **UX|UI**, and each member can focus on developing solutions
- **Delivery:** we proposed three actionable solutions which are implemented within six weeks
  - Refine ontology, data model and data pipeline
  - Search engine optimization with NLP approach 
  - Visual Prototype: redesign landing page, result search page and upload form


## Discover


### Assesment

After discussing the business goal and main requirement with the PO, we first reversed the existing website based on four criteria: design, structure, functionality and value propotion to identify initial problems.

### Competivie analysis

**Open Education Resource(OER)**: Medium, Google Scholar, MIT, Oercommons, BC campus and Europeana are chosen for benchmaking due to the platform type, content, and serivce they offer are very alike to OPENEDU.CH. Based on the these five main criteria:  information architecture, navigation, search function, filters and search results, we can further refine the OPENEDU Website.

### Persona

In addition, we also create 2 persona to get better understanding how OPENEDU.CH's user probably look like and be able to come up better solutions to tackle their problems

### User Interview

After completed the above analysis, key finding are extracted and formed five key subjects that we would like to further investigate through user interivew. the subjects are:

1. **The context**: In what situation educators would visit an educational resource platform

2. **Behaviour**: What do educators look for when visiting educational resource platforms

3. **Motivation**: What is the motivation for using an educational resource platform

4. **Expectation**: What product/ service do you expect to see on an educational resource platform 

5. **User Engagement**: What is the motivation for engaging with other users on an educational resource platform 



These five question are further elbrated into eight subquestions. To improve usability and user expereince of the curret site, a user testing was also given at the end of the interview. 

| Topic                                                        | Subject                                  |                                                              |

We conducted user interviews with 5 potential users (one internal and 4 external users.

- 90 % of the Users search bar to start their search on the majority platform
- Online Community, Peer review and students feedback are critical touchpoints
- Having a clear instructions and guidance would help the user to complete the uploading process
- Users wishing to get in touch with other teachers and connect in a simple, easy way



## Define

We collected ideas from team brainstorming, user interview and and competitive analysis, and we finally selected the most prominent features which are: **Search UI**, **Filters**, **Uploading Form**, and **Redesign Landing page** that are aligned with solution from our technical team, and be able to visualize in the final prototype


## Develop

At this stage, we compared potential solutions and we selected the most reasonable ideas to develop and listed in the table below:

| Features                 | Actions                                                      | Impact                                                       | Technique                                               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Search bar**           | 1.Enlarge and ceterned this feature in the landing page <br />2.Implement autocomplete function for key word search | Visible search UI especially on website with heavy information can help user to find content easily | A dummy UI intergrated with NLP,  semetic search        |
| **Filters**              | 1.Rename unclear or confuse filters<br />2.Remove overladped filters<br />3. Applied dropdown function on the filters<br />4. Applied Use vertical filters section help user to prioritize tasks they wish to do on the site | Eliminate uncertainty and confusion that can deter users motivation to use the website | Update the current database and adjsut  database schema |
| **Uploading Form**       | 1. Reduce user effort in the input fileds<br />2. Simplify uploading process with an indication and procedure<br />3. Tooltips | Reduce the obstacle and potential drop out during the process | UI only                                                 |
| **Website Landing page** | 1. Reduce information overload<br />2. Create **a clear message**: how people who you are, what do you do and what offers they can expect when visiting the website<br />3.Highlight<br/>**Call-to-Action** button to encourage users engagement | Building trust and connection users                          | UI only                                                 |



### User Flow

After we define the key features, I designed the user flow of the search and file uploading process.

## Prototype

In the design phase, we implemented the Mental model and design principle to reduce the cognitive loading on the web page by optimise user pleasant experiences that can helps them to easily navigate on the website.

### **Mental Model**

Mental model is a sort of thining system in our brain. It guides people to react and interate with somwthing based on what people see and what they believe in ther thinking system. Users expect what they believe and will interact with a product and service they have expereinced before. Therefore, making the website similar to their competitor can help users to easily navigate on the site without hesitating. 

### UI Redesign

- **Landing page**
  - Core message:  a short and power slogan tell users Who we are, what we do and what service and products offers on this site
  - Enlarge Search UI: make the search bar visible
  - CTA button: invite people to sign up and explore the site
  - Clear navigation: make the navigation visible to navigate users to visit different pages

- **Resource page: Use Dropdown animation in the filter feature**

- **Sign up pages**

In the sign up page, we want to collect more user basic information, not just their name and email. However, to make the user feel comfortable and share their information with us, we implemented some tags and a drop down menu to help users to fill out their information in a simple way.

- **Uploading Pages**

We make the uploading form simpler and divide the process into four steps, to make the user informed and know which section they are and be able to estimate how much time they need to complete this task.

### Proposed Result: Interactive Website Prototype 

A landing page and resouce page ared created in Figma. In addtion, three interative features can be test in this website prototype:

1. **Search bar**: try to entry "**scie**" and select **science competetion** then press **enter** to see the output search result 
2. **Filters**: a list of dropdown menu allow users to interacte with
3. **Sign up and uploading form**: you can access sign up page by click the sign up button, it will guide you through the sign up and add file processes

## Go to the Market

Now that we had achieved the outcome. our team also design and pitch desk to support the launch of these exciting features that we have developed over the past six week.

## Reflection

The purpose for this project is to provide tangible and actionable solutions for the client, although the redesign website was not required by the OpenEdu.ch, we believe having a website prototype that can visualize our solution in a feasible way is more convincing when pitching our idea, There were some flaws in the process and improvement that need to be addressed accordingly based on the data collection in the future development.
